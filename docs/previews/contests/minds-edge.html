        <h2>Unspoken Truths</h2>
        <p>Tom hasn’t been himself lately; something’s off.</p>
        <p>“Hey, Tom,” I ask, “Are you alright? You’ve been different lately.”</p>
        <p>He hesitates, eyes darting away, then quietly says, “I was diagnosed with brain cancer a few days ago.”</p>
        <p>The words hit me like a punch. Why hasn’t he told me? Tom isn’t close with his family, but this feels like more.</p>
        <p>The air hangs heavy. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”</p>
        <p>“I didn’t know how,” he murmurs, looking down. “I thought I could handle it. Didn’t want to burden anyone.”</p>
        <p>A lump forms in my throat. “You’re not a burden,” I say, my voice firm. “I’m here. Whatever you need, you’re not alone.”</p>
        <p>A flicker of relief crosses his face, but it fades quickly. “I’m not sure anyone can do anything for me now.”</p>
        <p>“Well, I’m still going to try,” I say, trying to pull him from his spiral.</p>
        <p>He doesn’t respond, but a faint, strained smile appears. Maybe it’s a start.</p>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Desperate Measures</h2>
        <p>Days pass, but something’s still off. Tom’s opened up a little, but he’s retreating. He’s spending longer hours in the lab, locking the door behind him.</p>
        <p>One evening, after Tom leaves, I stay behind. I notice a drawer in his workstation slightly ajar. Curiosity pulls me closer, and I find papers filled with intricate diagrams and formulas. One in particular catches my eye— “Neural implant,” “memory transfer,” and “neural integration.” A cold shiver runs down my spine as the words sink in.</p>
        <p>Tom’s not just trying to survive; he’s trying to cheat death.</p>
        <p>Footsteps snap me from my thoughts. I shove the papers back just as Tom enters, eyes flashing with panic before he masks it with a forced smile.</p>
        <p>“Didn’t expect you here, Axel.”</p>
        <p>“Just wondering what you’ve been working on,” I reply, trying to sound casual.</p>
        <p>He stiffens. “Just making the most of my time.”</p>
        <p>I step closer. “Tom, I saw the papers. What are you planning?”</p>
        <p>“I’m dying, Axel,” he says, looking away. “Doctors gave me months. I have to do this.”</p>
        <p>A knot tightens in my chest. “You want to upload yourself?”</p>
        <p>“It’s not perfect, but it’s close,” he murmurs. “This isn’t just for me. It could save others—imagine a world where no one has to die.”</p>
        <p>“Or one where people are trapped in ways we can’t even understand,” I counter. “This is dangerous, Tom.”</p>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>The Prototype</h2>
        <p>Weeks blur into a haze. Tom’s more withdrawn than ever. Every time I try to break through, he dodges, evades, deflects.</p>
        <p>One night, I got a message: “Meet me at the lab. I need your help.” No details, no context. Just those words.</p>
        <p>I go against my better judgment. This might be my only chance to find out what he’s really been up to.</p>
        <p>When I arrive, the lab is shrouded in shadows. The lab, usually filled with the hum of machines, is eerily silent. Only the faint glow of a workbench light illuminates the space. Tom stands at a workbench, his back to me. On the table is a sleek, metallic device—small, intricate, and undeniably menacing.</p>
        <p>“Tom, what is this?” My voice is tight.</p>
        <p>“It’s a prototype,” he says, not turning around. “A neural implant. I need your help to test it.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Bound by Thought</h2>
        <p>When I come to, everything feels wrong. My vision flickers and there’s an incessant buzzing in my ears. A strange sensation grips my mind, like cold tendrils burrowing into my thoughts. Panic rises as I try to move—but I can’t.</p>
        <p>“What did you do?” My voice is slow, disoriented.</p>
        <p>Tom stands before me, his expression unreadable. “I connected you,” he says quietly. “The implant lets me see your thoughts, your intentions. And if necessary…” He pauses. “...adjust them.”</p>
        <p>“No…” My voice cracks. “You’re controlling me?”</p>
        <p>“Not entirely,” he says. “Think of it as guidance. I won’t hurt you, Axel. I just need to make sure you don’t… interfere.”</p>
